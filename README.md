# Granite Code Cookbook

The code of conduct for the Granite Code Cookbook can be found on the AI Alliance [contribute](https://thealliance.ai/contribute) page.
Rather than maintain copies in two places, we refer you to that page for the details, rather than have a copy here.

For information about contributing to this repo, code of conduct guidelines, etc., see the [community](https://github.com/granite-cookbooks/community) project.
